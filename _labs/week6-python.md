title: "Week 6: [Very short introduction to plotting statistics in Python] & [RPM measurements on a cordless screwdriver using senseHAT]"
---

**Goals:** 
1. **DeepNote:** To get started on making basic statistics from data gathered in the lab using Python
2. **microLab:** To measure the Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) os a cordless screwdriver using a senseHAT and Raspberry Pi 3B+ 

**Downloadable Resources:** 

NOTE: Python lecture/demo and homework files are already on your DeepNote project pages and included here as downloadable content
