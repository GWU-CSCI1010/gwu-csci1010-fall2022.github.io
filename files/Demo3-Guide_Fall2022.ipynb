Dataframes are a way to represent data in rows and columns, much like a matrix!! \n\nA little vocab to get us started. I promise it won't be much. \n- The **columns** of a dataframe are called the **columns**\n- The **rows** of the dataframe are called the **index** \n\nSee that wasn't too bad :)\n\nLast week we discussed importing data from a csv file into a pandas dataframe. We are going to bring that back and do a whole lot more with it this week! We have provided a csv file in this week's content for this demonstration! \n\n\n\n#### Here are the steps!\n1. Locate the file titled `DemoCSV1.csv` in the DeepNote file tree (on the left of the screen). You may have to click the `Notebooks and Files` icon on the top left to see this\n\n2. Click the 3 dots. This should bring you to a drop down menu. \n\n3. Click `Copy Path to Clipboard` from the dropdown menu!\n\n4. Establish a `filename` variable in a code cell that is an empty string using `filename = ''`\n\n5. Inside the quotes paste the path using `Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V` on your keyboard\n\n6. You should now have something like this: `filename = '/work/Week3/DemoCSV1.csv'`\n\n7. Finally, use `df = pd.read_csv(filename)` to save your file into a pandas dataframe!\n\n\nToday's `DemoCSV1.csv` originally comes from the module [vega_datasets](https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/) if you are curious.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"6edf4ff5d6a2405aa333e29857269b8f","deepnote_cell_height":574.171875,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"filename = 'Week3/DemoCSV1.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(filename)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"7180c21a5e8449c3ad9cb9d0a82befbf","source_hash":"eec7ef6e","execution_start":1665524109689,"execution_millis":6,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Showing Dataframes\nTo show dataframes, we have a couple of options!
