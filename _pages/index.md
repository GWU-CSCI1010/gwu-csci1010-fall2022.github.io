### Thinking Ahead & Getting Involved
After CS 1010 and APSC 1001, we encourage you to explore SEAS! 
This is a great way to figure out what you're interested in and meet new people (especially once you're back on campus)! One particularly good way to do this is to check out the student organizations around SEAS:

- [Presenters from class on 11/20](/files/student_orgs.pdf)
- <a href="https://www.seas.gwu.edu/student-organizations" target="_blank">Official GWU SEAS list of affiliated student orgs</a>
